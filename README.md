# School Disctrict Analysis 
## Overview of School District Analysis 
We are performing a data analysis over the information of schools and students in a School District City. We should obtain performance trends after the analysis. This analysis will help the student board in making decisions regarding the school budgets and priorities. The school dataset have columns with school id, school name, type of school, size and budget.
